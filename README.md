# Strange attractors
From an article i found from https://paulbourke.net/fractals/lyapunov/

Automatic generation of attractors by using Lyapunov exponents to calculate promising chaothic attractors (and discarding point or infinity attractors)

## TODO
- add symbolic equations and save them as parameters. that way, automatic equation generation will be a possibility (with arbitrary params)
- merge this into the other code to allow for colouring, etc.
- test the corect loading with seed points: all attractors should work when loaded
